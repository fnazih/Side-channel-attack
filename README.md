# Side-channel-attack

This repository contains my personal Matlab work on side-channel attack in practical course.

The objective of this practical course is to attack an AES algorithm by listening to the EM waves issued by the AES algorithm on a hardware tool.
Final task : to be able to guess the 128-bits key used in the algorithm, where all the secret and security of the ciphering remains.

To do so, we decided to analyze the subbytes step's consumption, which is non-linear.
